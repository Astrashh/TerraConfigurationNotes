alias:: FEATURE

- Feature configs define the combination of:
	- A collection of [[Structures]] and
	- *Where* those structures should be placed.
- Feature configs allow you to define a placement pattern of a collection of [[Structures]], which are used inside [[BIOME]] configs.
- For example, you may have a couple tree variations, this would be your collection of structures. Then you have a couple rules on where these tree variations are allowed to be placed.
