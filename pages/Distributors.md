- Distributors are defined in [[FEATURE]] configs under the `distributor` [[config key]].
- Distributors determine which columns in the world [[Locators]] should operate in.
- Distributors operate in 2D. For each set of 2D coordinates within the biome, a locator will return either *true* or *false*, where true means the locator will be applied for the column of blocks to determine where a [[Structure]] can generate.
