- This site is an unofficial knowledge base for creating Terra config packs. You can find the official documentation at https://terra.polydev.org/.
- ## Why Unofficial?
- Official documentation with higher standards takes more time and effort to maintain, both of which have been barriers to producing a sufficient *quantity* of configuration information to be useful.
  
  This site serves as a more casual informal format, where information can be stringed together in a 'quantity over quality' format to be practically usable for config development where official documentation is lacking.
- ## Contributions
- This is not intended to be a collaborative project (but may move in that direction in the future), however requests for information via the repository [issue tracker](https://github.com/Astrashh/TerraConfigurationNotes/issues) are appreciated!
- You can find the source for this knowledge base here https://github.com/Astrashh/TerraConfigurationNotes.
- If you do wish to contribute anyway, [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) is the tool used to edit, you can simply clone the repository locally and open it in Logseq and any changes will be represented in the plain text files.
