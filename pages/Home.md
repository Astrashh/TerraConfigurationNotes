- This site is an unofficial knowledge base for creating Terra config packs. You can find the official documentation at https://terra.polydev.org/.
- ## Why Unofficial?
- Official documentation with higher standards takes more time and effort to maintain, both of which have been barriers to producing a sufficient *quantity* of configuration information to be useful.
  
  This site serves as a more casual informal format, where information can be stringed together in a 'quantity over quality' format to be practically usable for config development where official documentation is lacking.
