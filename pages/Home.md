- This site is an unofficial knowledge base for creating Terra config packs. You can find the official documentation at https://terra.polydev.org/.
- You can find the source for this knowledge base here https://github.com/Astrashh/TerraConfigurationNotes.
- ## Why Unofficial?
- Official documentation with higher standards takes more time and effort to maintain, this serves as a more casual informal format,  stringing together enough information to be practically usable for config development where official documentation is lacking.
